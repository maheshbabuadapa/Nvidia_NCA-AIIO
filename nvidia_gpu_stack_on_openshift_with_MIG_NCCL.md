# 🧠 NVIDIA GPU Stack Integration on OpenShift (Kubernetes) — with MIG & NCCL

## 1️⃣ Overview

This guide explains how **NVIDIA’s AI inference stack** — including **NGC**, **Dynamo**, **Triton**, **CUDA**, **MIG**, and **NCCL** — fits together inside a **Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster** to run GPU-accelerated workloads such as Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 🧩 9️⃣ NVIDIA NCCL (Collective Communication Library)

### 🔹 What is NCCL

**NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communication Library)** is a **software library** that enables **fast communication between multiple GPUs**, either within the same server or across nodes in a cluster.

It’s pronounced **“Nickel.”**

> **NCCL = GPU-to-GPU communication engine**

---

### ⚙️ How NCCL Works

NCCL provides optimized implementations of key **collective operations** used in training and large-scale inference:

| Operation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **AllReduce** | Combines data from all GPUs (e.g., summing gradients) |
| **AllGather** | Gathers data from all GPUs into each GPU |
| **Broadcast** | Sends data from one GPU to all others |
| **ReduceScatter** | Combines and distributes data among GPUs |

These operations are fundamental for **distributed AI** workloads — allowing multiple GPUs to share results quickly and efficiently.

### 🔩 How NCCL Communicates

NCCL runs **in software**, but it uses **hardware interconnects** for high-speed data transfer:

| Hardware | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **NVLink** | High-speed GPU↔GPU link inside a single server | 2–8 GPUs in one box |
| **NVSwitch** | Internal switch that connects many NVLinks | DGX/HGX servers |
| **InfiniBand** | Network fabric connecting GPUs across servers | Multi-node clusters |

NCCL automatically detects which interconnects exist and **chooses the fastest path**.

> 🧠 Think of NCCL as the “traffic controller” and NVLink/NVSwitch/InfiniBand as the “roads and highways” carrying the data.

### ⚙️ In the Dynamo–Triton–CUDA Stack

| Layer | Component | Role |
|--------|------------|------|
| **Orchestration** | **NVIDIA Dynamo** | Decides which GPUs or nodes to use |
| **Runtime** | **NVIDIA Triton** | Runs model inference workloads |
| **Communication** | **NCCL** | Enables fast GPU-to-GPU data exchange |
| **Hardware** | **NVLink / NVSwitch / InfiniBand** | Physical data transfer medium |

> When Triton runs multi-GPU inference, NCCL ensures data moves efficiently between GPUs using NVLink, NVSwitch, or InfiniBand.

### 🧩 NCCL Analogy

| Concept | Analogy |
|----------|----------|
| **NCCL** | Traffic control system for GPU data |
| **NVLink** | Local road between two GPUs |
| **NVSwitch** | City roundabout connecting all roads |
| **InfiniBand** | Highway connecting multiple cities (servers) |
| **CUDA** | Workers performing computation |
| **Dynamo / Triton** | Managers assigning and executing workloads |

---

### ✅ Summary

| Layer | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **NCCL** | Software | GPU communication library that uses hardware below |
| **NVLink** | Hardware | Fast GPU↔GPU link (in-server) |
| **NVSwitch** | Hardware | Connects multiple GPUs via NVLink |
| **InfiniBand** | Hardware | Network connecting GPUs across servers |
| **CUDA** | Software | Core GPU compute engine |
| **Triton / Dynamo** | Software | Serve and orchestrate workloads |
| **MIG** | Hardware virtualization | Partitions GPU into isolated slices |

### 🧩 OpenShift Integration

- **NCCL** comes **pre-installed** in NVIDIA containers (Triton, TensorRT-LLM, PyTorch).  
- **GPU Operator** ensures NCCL, drivers, and CUDA libraries are consistent.  
- **Pods using multiple GPUs** (for distributed training or inference) automatically use NCCL via the framework (PyTorch, TensorRT-LLM, etc.).

> You rarely configure NCCL directly — it’s automatically used when multi-GPU workloads run in Triton or TensorRT-LLM.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

> **NCCL = software communication layer.**  
> **NVLink / NVSwitch / InfiniBand = hardware data paths.**  
> Together, they let multiple GPUs in a cluster act as one powerful compute unit.
